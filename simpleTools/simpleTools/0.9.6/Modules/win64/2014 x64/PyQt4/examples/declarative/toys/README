These pure QML examples demonstrate some of what can be easily done using just
a few QML files.

The example launcher provided with PyQt can be used to explore each of the
examples in this directory. They can also be viewed directly with the
QML viewer utility, without requiring compilation.

Documentation for these examples can be found via the Tutorial and Examples
link in the main PyQt documentation.
