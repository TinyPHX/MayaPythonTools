With Qt Declarative, it is easy to implement the UI components that you need
in exactly the way that you want. These examples demonstrate this by creating
a selection of user interface components where the look and feel has been
completely defined in a QML file.

The example launcher provided with PyQt can be used to explore each of the
examples in this directory. But most can also be viewed directly with the
QML viewer utility, without requiring compilation.

Documentation for these examples can be found via the Tutorials and Examples
link in the main PyQt documentation.
